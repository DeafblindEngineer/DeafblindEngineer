# Deafblind Engineer

Hello. I am Gizmo. The Deafblind Engineer. An engineer powered by braille.

I am a passionate engineer, and an all-around computer geek who enjoys solving problems for myself, and others. I am always up for a challenge and enjoy learning new technologies. By day I am an accessibility-conscious full-stack web developer and DevOps engineer. By night, a software engineer, and data science practitioner. I might not be where I want to be yet, but I get closer every day.
