# Deafblind Engineer
I'm a Deafblind Engineer living in a dark silent world. Born deaf. Gone blind.

I started my web development journey in the mid-nineties before the war of the browsers. These days my core focus is on full-stack web development, accessibility, and DevOps.

### Deafblind Social Project
**Project Technologies:**
* ReactJS, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Redis, and Nginx

**Project Overview:**

The Deafblind Social Project is a self-hosted Mastodon Instance. This Mastodon Instance has been setup with me being the only account so that I can run it like personal Micro Blog. But I am not isolated on my own server. I am able to follow anyone on any other server, and they can follow me. We can exchange messages as if we were on the same server.

### Wiki Project
**Project Technologies:**
* LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MariDB, PHP) and MediaWiki

**Project Overview:**

I used to have the customary blog where I wrote about full-stack web development, accessibility, and DevOps from the viewpoint of a Deafblind Engineer. But like many bloggers I neglected it as I was too busy working on my projects.

So I thought it would be easier and more interesting to have a publicly accessible wiki instead of a blog. It would be a good resource for me as much as anyone else. A place to document everything related to being a #Deafblind Engineer.
