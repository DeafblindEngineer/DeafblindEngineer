# Deafblind Engineer

Hello. I am Gizmo. The Deafblind Engineer. An engineer powered by braille.

I am a passionate engineer, and an all-around computer geek who enjoys solving problems for myself, and others. I am always up for a challenge and enjoy learning new technologies. By day I am an accessibility-conscious full-stack web developer and DevOps engineer. By night, a software engineer, artificial intelligence engineer, and data science practitioner. I might not be where I want to be yet, but I get closer every day.

## Website
* Deafblind Engineer: [https://deafblind.engineer](https://deafblind.engineer)

## Projects

### Full-Stack Web Development:

#### The Calma Project

* [The Calma Project](https://deafblind.engineer/pages/project/the-calma-project) is the project codename for [https://deafblind.engineer](https://deafblind.engineer) that has recently been refreshed to discuss new and old ideas, not just in web development, and blind computing but also in science, engineering, and architecture in general.

#### The Minasurië Project

* The Minasurië Project is a website dedicated to my artificial intelligence project (The Sanwë Project) which is currently under development. It will focus on my investigations to seek out research challanges in AI; both in terms of fundamental development of AI and application use of AI.

### DevOps:

#### The Tengwar Project

* [The Tengwar Project](https://deafblind.engineer/pages/project/the-tengwar-project) is about building an agile DevOps workflow that will let me write code, integrate it, run tests, deliver releases, and deploy changes to the software in real-time to [The Calma Project](https://deafblind.engineer/pages/project/the-calma-project).

#### The Maitalë Project

* The Maitalë Project is the codename for the DevOps Lab that I have built using readily available hardware to experiment with the ever-evolving landscape of new open-source software and tools together with DevOps practices

### Hardware and Software Engineering:

#### The Palantíri Project

* [The Palantíri Project](https://deafblind.engineer/pages/project/the-palantiri-project) is part of my research into concurrent, parallel, and distributed computing. The core focus of this project is to employ the availability of inexpensive computing tools to achieve both the computing and processing power of supercomputers at a minimum cost.

#### The Tinco Project

* The Tinco Project is my forays into bare metal programming. Currently I am programming on two different hardware: Intel (Intel NUC), and Arm (Raspberry Pi 4). The embedded software languages I am working with are C, C++, and Rust.

#### The Ceulë Project

* The Ceulë Project is a project to revive the ElBraille V40 5th Gen. by installing a Linux distro on the device and developing custom drivers to make the entire hardware fully functional under Linux. I am testing three distros: Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux. The drivers are being written in C and C++.

### Artificial Intelligence and Data Science:

#### The Sanwë Project

* The Sanwë Project is the codename I have given to my artificial intelligence research and development laboratory (AI R&D Lab). The core focus of the lab is on my investigations into the interdisciplinary fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing.
